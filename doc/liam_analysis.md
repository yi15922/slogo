###InputConsole

Created InputConsole class extending JavaFX TextArea modifications could be 
done to the input console on the GUI without changing code inside View, thereby leaving
View open but closed.

Added listeners to the input button so that potential future components requiring user input can be added 
without modifying InputConsole.
