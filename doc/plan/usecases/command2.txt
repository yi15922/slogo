The user types 'make x 25' in the command window, and sees a new variable 'x' in the workspace
with value 25.

- User presses run button
- Controller for console panel takes the text
- parser pulls text from controller
- Parser turns make, x, and 25 into their respective tokens.
  - make is a command, x is a generic token, and 25 is a constant
- Compiler creates new function with these tokens.
- The function recognizes first token is command make
- make.isReady()
  - returns false because it has not been given parameters
- function looks at next token, which is type token
  - function calls make.getNextExpectedToken() with generic token
- function looks at following token, which is type constant
  - function calls make.getNextExpectedToken() with constant token
- make.isReady() now returns true so function calls make.perform()
- make creates new variable token with the name of the generic token and the value of the constant
- make places new variable token in the workspace
- controller alerts view that a new variable has been added to the workspace
- workspace view updates itself with the new variable name and value
