The user types 'fd fd 50' in the command window, and sees the turtle move 100 units (since the inner
'fd 50' moves 50 and returns 50 to the outer command)

- User presses run button
- Controller for console panel takes the text
- parser pulls text from controller
- Parser turns fd, fd, and 50 into their respective tokens.
- Compiler creates new function with these tokens.
- The function recognizes first token is command fd
- fd.isReady()
  - fd returns false because it has not been given parameter
- function looks at next token, which is command fd2
- fd2.isReady() on the next token
  - fd2 also returns false because it has not been given parameter
- function looks at next token, which is type constant
  - calls fd2.giveNextExpectedToken() with constant token 50
- fd2.isReady()
- it is ready, so function calls fd2.perform()
  - turtle.move(50) and returns 50
- now the function calls fd.giveNextExpectedToken() with the value 50 wrapped in a constant token
- fd.isReady() is now true
- fd.perform() on first command
  - turtle.move(50)
- controller alerts view as it is constantly checking the location
- view.updateTurtleCoordinates(x,y)
