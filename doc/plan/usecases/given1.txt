The user types 'fd 50' in the command window, and sees the turtle move in the display window
leaving a trail, and the command is added to the environment's history.

- User presses run button
- Controller for console panel takes the text
- parser pulls text from controller
- Parser turns fd and 50 into their respective tokens.
- Compiler creates new function with these tokens.
- The function recognizes first token is command
- command.isReady()
  - command returns false because it has not been given parameter
- function looks at next token, which is type constant
  - therefore does command.giveNextExpectedToken(), passing the 50 to it
- command.isReady()
- it is ready, so calls command.perform()
- turle.move(50)
- controller alerts view as it is constantly checking the location
- view.updateTurtle(x,y)
